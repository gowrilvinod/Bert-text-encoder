# Bert-text-encoder

This repository provides a streamlined pipeline for preprocessing and encoding text using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a powerful transformer-based model that captures contextual relationships in text.

## Purpose

The repository demonstrates:
- Preprocessing text using a BERT preprocessing model.
- Encoding text to obtain embeddings using a BERT encoder model.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure Python (>=3.6) and required libraries are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub tensorflow-text
   ```

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize BERT preprocessing and encoder models.
   - Preprocess text to tokenize and prepare it for encoding.
   - Encode preprocessed text to obtain embeddings.

3. **Integration**: Use BERT embeddings for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or text classification.
